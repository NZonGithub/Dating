We aren't some major company. And I am definitely not economically capable of hosting a big platform with a server on which everything is stored.
But this can be a good thing for us. I have some ideas on how we can make the server store fewer than a megabyte per person, while at the same time making all the user data a lot more private.
What is that you might ask? Everything about you, is stored locally.
Every connection will be done peer to peer, and big group connections just won't exist for a while.
Maybe when I'll add them, one person will just be chosen as the host, and then everyone connects to them.
Peer to peer becomes exponentially more expensive with more people being added.
